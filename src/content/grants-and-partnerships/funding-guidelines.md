## Funding Guidelines

The McKinney Family Foundation (MFF) operates within the model of [trust-based philanthropy](https://www.trustbasedphilanthropy.org/), which includes the practice of granting unrestricted funds that may be used for operating support, salaries, or overhead. MFF trusts our grantees to ensure the funds are used where they are most needed, have the greatest impact, and allow for new or urgent action.

MFF is committed to building an environmentally sustainable future for every Hoosier, therefore our grantmaking is focused within the state of Indiana. Our primary areas of focus are:

1. Expanding a sustainable clean energy economy through renewable energy jobs creation and meaningful policy change.
2. Advancing an inclusive democracy to address economic and health disparities and their impacts on environmental outcomes. 
3. Ensuring the long-term viability of the nonprofit environmental sector through capacity building and leadership development.
