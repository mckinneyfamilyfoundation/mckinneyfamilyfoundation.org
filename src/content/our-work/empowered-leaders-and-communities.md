## Empowered Leaders and Communities

MFF is dedicated to ensuring the long-term viability of the nonprofit environmental sector through capacity building and leadership development.

Our work supports partnerships that encourage civic engagement and education across a spectrum of people curious for solutions – students, educators, communities, and experts.

MFF supports the next generation of sustainability leaders and contributes to climate and resilience projects through professional development opportunities and training. Funded programs empower those working in the field with resources and tools for organizational, professional, and personal growth.

With the expectation of final grants distribution in our sunset year of 2036, we believe it is imperative that the environmental community has the expertise, resources, and support necessary to be self-sustaining and successful in their efforts to improve the environmental, economic, and health outcomes for the state of Indiana.
