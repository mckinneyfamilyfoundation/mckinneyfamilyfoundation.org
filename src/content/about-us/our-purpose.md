## Our Purpose

The McKinney Family Foundation:

* Convenes local, regional, and national experts, advocates, and funders to form a collaborative and coordinated infrastructure for environmental change.
* Provides expertise on Indiana environmental issues with community based organizations, civic and nonprofit organizations, and peer funders.
* Serves as Indiana’s anchor funder and the hub for national peer funders to support this work in Indiana.
* Connects organizations seeking funding outside of MFF’s scope to peer funders who may support those efforts.
