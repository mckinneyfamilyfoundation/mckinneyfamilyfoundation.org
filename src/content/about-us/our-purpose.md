## Our Purpose

The McKinney Family Foundation:
- Convenes local, regional, and national experts, advocates, and funders to form a collaborative and coordinated infrastructure for environmental change.
- Provides expertise on Indiana environmental issues with advocacy groups, civic and nonprofit organizations, and peer funders.
- Serves as Indiana’s anchor funder and the hub for national peer funders to support this work in Indiana.
- Connects organizations seeking funding outside of MFF’s scope to peer funders who may support those efforts.
