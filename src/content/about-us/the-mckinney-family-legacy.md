## The McKinney Family Legacy

The McKinney Family Foundation (MFF) is a multi-generation family foundation established in 2010 by Robert H. and Arlene A. McKinney and his five children – Robert C. McKinney, Marni McKinney Waterfield, Kevin K. McKinney, Kent A. McKinney, and Lisa C. McKinney.

In addition to MFF’s focus areas, Mr. McKinney’s personal philanthropy supports postsecondary and legal education and scholarship at the United States Naval Academy, Indiana University, IU Robert H. McKinney School of Law, Earlham College, University of California Berkeley, Marian University, as well as numerous community-based and civic organizations.

The Foundation’s early work primarily focused on conservation, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, supporting the city of Indianapolis’ sustainability initiatives, higher education and the arts. Today, MFF strives to be the foremost catalyst for climate change solutions, environmental progress, and leadership in Indiana.
